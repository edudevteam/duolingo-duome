### Info from Shneancy

##### Disclaimer:

Everything was sourced from duome.eu who in turn sourced it all from duolingo. I don't own any of those. I only reshaped the information into something you can print and have a physical copy of.

##### Printing

- The booklet versions are set up to be printed on both sides so you can then assemble them into booklets.
- Make sure you selected "flip on short side" so it to prints properly (if "flip on long side" is selected it will print the other side upside down)
- If your printer doesn't let you choose on which side to flip and it prints it wrong and your course isn't too long, I recommend https://www.pdf2go.com/rotate-pdf to flip every second page upside down. If you don't feel like doing that, go to a printing shop and just tell them what you want.
- English -> Norwegian, English -> Scottish, English -> German, Russian -> German, Russian -> English, are all huge files with A LOT of pages even when you print them in booklet form and double sided, so if you want those I recommend you pay a printing place to do it for you unless you have a ton of paper and ink laying around.
- If you want it to be one sided either print the simple version normally or print the simple version as 2 per page in landscape mode to save on paper.

##### Limitations

Of course any links you find won't work no matter how hard you tap the paper, some courses are heavy on links and some don't have any, check and judge for yourself if a file is worth printing. I've noticed especially English -> Indonesian has a ton of links.

There are a few coursers missing because there weren't any materials worth printing on duome.eu. By this I mean if a course only had an introductory line such as "welcome to the Ukrainian course!" I just skipped it.

If you have any questions or special requests you can find me on reddit as u/Shneancy or e-mail saide1.ss@gmail.com. As I use a 3rd party app for reddit I don't get notifications for DMs so for me to see you you'll have to respond to my comment or post.

##### Have fun learning :)

28.05.2022 - first upload
29.05.2022 - all files cleaned from web specific artifacts. Method used also removed page numbering. Added page numbering to booklet versions. Simple pdf version remain unnumbered as the website I used has a limit per browser per day. I'll fix this once I can but you can do it yourself as well on online2pdf.com
30.05.2022 - all files are now clean and have all pages numbered

## In Development

> The following is dependent upon Duolingo's approval.

If you don’t want to print and bind your own books, then we have provided a way using amazon to print the book. The cost is based on Amazon’s cost to print the book. We’ve decided to go with Amazon.com for printing because it seemed like the easiest way to go in terms of payment and accessibility.

We cannot guarantee that the content will always be up to date.
This project is meant as a supportive in hands tool to help you as you use the Duolingo application/website and not meant as a replacement.
